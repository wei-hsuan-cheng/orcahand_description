# Orcahand Description

This repository contains the description files for the Orcahand model (both URDF and MJCF).

Versioned model layouts live under:
- `v1/`: legacy hand description files, including the `extended` variants
- `v2/`: updated hand description files from the newer Fusion360 export

The `extended` version contains additional bodies (incl. inertial properties) such as the camera mount, the U2D2 board and fans.

## Example Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wei-hsuan-cheng/orcahand_description.git
   cd orcahand_description
   ```
2. Install the required visualization dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install mujoco
   ```
3. Simulate any version using MuJoCo:
   ```bash
   python3 -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=$(pwd)/v1/scene_combined.xml
   python3 -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf=$(pwd)/v2/scene_combined.xml
   ```

## Note on Meshes
Visual meshes contain the following amount of faces:
- Main tower, camera & fans: 15'000
- Rest of base: 2'000
- Skin: 5'000
- Rest: 500

Collision meshes contain the following amount of faces:
- Main tower, camera & fans: 7500
- Rest of base: 1000
- Skin: 500
- Rest: 250

You can further reduce or mirror meshes using the `utils/mesh_utils.py` script. With the same script, you can also print their number of faces. Some extra dependencies are required:
```bash
cd utils
pip3 install -r utils_requirements.txt
```

We can also recommend the VSCode extension `mtsmfm.vscode-stl-viewer` for quickly visualizing STL meshes.
